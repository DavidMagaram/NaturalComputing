## Write inspirations you got from other people's papers!

* We should include relevant equations
* a graph showing how speed changes with number of cells & obstacles
* We should probably have a table with all chosen parameters and justify the important ones
* We need a proper research question that is posed and answered
* > Does the answer mention the alignment of directions in the scenario without obstacles, which is disturbed when obstacles are present? I don't think ours does
* Implement Migration of cells: the correct choice was maxact=80; see ex 1.3
* > Is it clear which statements are factual observations (“the cells did X in context Y”) and which are interpretations thereof (“these findings suggest that obstacles do X”)? I don't think we really do that either
* > Are the methods described sufficiently well that you could reproduce the work without looking at the code? This means the report should include:
    • All the relevant parameters used, including the temperature T and boundary conditions
    • If adhesion values J are given in a matrix, it should be clear which celltypes are in the rows and columns;
    • Densities of cells and obstacles (or numbers, but then the size of the simulation field should be included) No
* Are there any other reasons why results may not be reproducible? Yes
